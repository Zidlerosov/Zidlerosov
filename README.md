Hello, this is my little password manager i made for myself

first you need to select a secret, the moment you save a password with this secret you must remember it

you can use commands:

>pull
 to see all stored passwords, if the secret you entered is wrong, the passwords dont show

>generate *number*
  generates a password of *number* length, it will include upper string char, lower string char, digit and special char

>add *new pass*
 save your own already made password

>w/wipe
 clear console, you have to enter secret again


Doesnt have much functionality for now, no error handling and pretty strict manual of usage, didnt really spend much time on it yet
